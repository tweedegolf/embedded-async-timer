//! Async timers for embedded devices in Rust.
//!
//! This crate provides an interface and a generic implemention of a timer that can handle multiple
//! concurrent deadlines using the Future architecture provided by Rust. This crate also provides
//! two reference implementations for this interface for the STM32F103 and STM32L476.
//!
//! Using implementations for the `Timer` trait, you can instance an `AsyncTimer` that provides methods
//! to concurrently wait on a specific deadline or duration with a `Future`-compatible interface.
//! Using this crate you can implement device drivers that require delays. Using HAL crates that are
//! compatible with `embedded-async-timer` you can develop firmware that directly require delays or use
//! these aforementioned drivers.
//! For HAL RTC implementations with alarms it should be trivial to adapt them to implement the `Timer` trait.
//! View the STM32F103 example in the `impls` module for inspiration.
//!
//! **Note:** until `const_generics` lands the capacity for AsyncTimer is hard-coded.
//!
//! **Note:** the current design assumes a `bare_metal`-like single core architecture that supports
//! `interrupt::free`-like blocks. In the future I would like to rewrite everything to no longer require this.
//!
//! **Note:** the priority queue used in this implementation is very likely to not be the most efficient choice of data structure.
//! I intend to experiment with various setups to make an informed performance consideration based on real
//! measurements given a small amount of concurrent timers.
//!
//! **State:** this crate has been tested with trivial examples on two embedded devices, but has not yet
//! been applied in production. It is beyond a simple proof of concept though. Our intention to provide a
//! basis for an async ecosystem. The quality might also be insufficient to run on production.
//! Also the current state of async-await might be such that it is practically unusable for memory constrained embedded devices.
//! We encourage developing async HAL drivers using this crate though.
//!
//! # Example
//! ```rust
//! async {
//!     let timer = AsyncTimer::new(rtc);
//!     timer.wait(Duration::from_millis(500).into()).await;
//!
//!     let mut interval = Interval::new(Duration::from_secs(1).into(), &timer);
//!
//!     loop {
//!         interval.wait(&timer).await;
//!         println!("ping");
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
